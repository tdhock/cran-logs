\section{Introduction}

Log files were downloaded from
\url{http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/}. These files log ONLY the
downloads from ONE of the several dozen CRAN servers.

The point of this analysis is to estimate the usage of some of my
packages.

\newpage

\section{Initial analysis}

I plot the total number of downloads per day over time for several
packages.

These plots show a weak signal that directlabels may be more popular
than inlinedocs, but the only clear trend is that ggplot2 has an order
of magnitude more downloads. You can even see that people use it
during the work week!

There are some common patterns in each of the bottom 5 unpopular
packages. This suggests a normalization or background subtraction
procedure may be necessary to get an accurate estimate of the number
of real users.
